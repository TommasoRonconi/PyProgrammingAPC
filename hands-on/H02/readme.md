# Estimating $\pi$

In this exercise we will try to estimate the value of $\pi$ numerically.

> every time you want to implement something, it is most likely because you want to answer a question.
> Our question today is:

> **What is \pi?**

Before starting to think algorithmically, we want to think scientifically: "what do we know about $\pi$?"
